      <h2>Cryptocurrency</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>What is it?</strong> Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form
        of currency that uses cryptography for security and operates on a
        decentralized network called blockchain.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How it works?</strong> Cryptocurrencies work on a technology
        called blockchain, which is a distributed ledger that records all
        transactions across a network of computers. It uses cryptography to
        secure transactions and control the creation of new units.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example</strong>: Bitcoin is a popular example of a
        cryptocurrency. It allows peer-to-peer transactions without the need for
        a central authority or government.
      </p>

      <h2>Decentralized Trading Platform</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>What is it?</strong> A Decentralized Trading Platform (DTP) is a
        system that enables users to trade financial assets directly without the
        need for intermediaries like brokers. It operates on a decentralized
        network, providing more control and transparency to users.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How it works?</strong> DTPs use blockchain technology to
        facilitate and verify transactions. Smart contracts, self-executing
        contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code,
        play a crucial role in automating and securing trades on these
        platforms.
